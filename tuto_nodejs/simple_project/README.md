# Simple Node.js Project

## Setup
To set up this project, I ran the following command:
```bash
npm init
```
Then, in the `package.json`, I added the start script under "scripts":
```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
}
```

## Running index.js
To run the `index.js` file, you can use the following command (make sure you are in the correct folder):
```bash
node index.js
```

Alternatively, you can use the script configured in `package.json`:
```bash
npm run start
```
